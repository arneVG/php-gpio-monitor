# php-gpio-monitor
A poorly made GPIO monitor for the Raspberry Pi.
Just a singular PHP file! (Don't ask why)

# installation and requirements
Just install a webserver of choice on your Raspberry Pi and place the PHP file in the html directory.
Requires WiringPi to be installed on the Raspberry Pi. Should work on every Raspberry Pi model (only tested on Pi zero and Pi 3B).
